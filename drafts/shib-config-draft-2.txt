---- START CUT ------------------
FIXME: All the prose is broken here, I haven't gotten the IdP to actually use the htpasswd file correctly and the admin user setup for Hello world returns 500 errors.

### Next two steps

As stated in [Configuration](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDP4/pages/1265631515/Configuration) the first step to bring up an IdP from scratch is to configure

1. [Authentication](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDP4/pages/1265631601)
2. [Attribute Resolver](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDP4/pages/1265631549)

Then we can move onto the [Hello World](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDP4/pages/1289683553) and see if things actually work.


Configure authentication starts with loading the idp.authn.Password
module.

```shell
    # NOTE: we should be the root user and
    # the working directory is assumed to be /opt/shibboleth-idp
    # where we installed our IdP software.
    bin/module.sh -t idp.authn.Password
    bin/module.sh -e idp.authn.Password
```

Update `conf/authn/password-authn-config.xml` uncommenting the line with `shibboleth.HTPasswdValidator` and commenting out the line with `shibboleth.LDAPValidator` .  We also need to create the "demo.htpasswd" file in the `credentials` directory.

```shell
    vi conf/authn/password-authn-config.xml
    htpasswd -c credentials/demo.htpasswd admin
    chown jetty:adm credentials/demo.htpasswd
    chmod 660 credentials/demo.htpasswd
```

FIXME: This isn't enough to configure the authentication, haven't even got to the Attribute Resolver yet!


### Setting Hello World to test

I recommend enabling the "hello" or "hello world" module. Flows are the data paths take when a user authenticates via Shibboleth's IdP. The "hello" module provides a way to see if the IdP is working without having a service provider implemented yet (see [HelloWorldConfiguration](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDP4/pages/1289683553/HelloWorldConfiguration) for details).

Modules can be enable, disabled and tests. Shibboleth IdP 4 package provides a script for that. The `modules.sh` script is found in the `bin` folder. It has a `--help` option which explains how it can be used.

While the status end point indicates the `idp.admin.Hello` module is enabled it doesn't work  out of the box.  These are the step I took
to get it working and confirm the IdP was working before going on to configure it.

```shell
    sudo su
    cd /opt/shibboleth-idp
    ./bin/module.sh -t idp.admin.Hello
    ./bin/module.sh -e idp.admin.Hello
```

FIXME: This is failing, status 500, probably because authentication module isn't configured yet though there is some ambiguity in the docs

If this works then we can test it.

```shell
    lynx http://localhost:8080/idp/profile/admin/hello
```

If you get a 500 error then something isn't working yet.  It is probably something more that needs to be configured.


### Configuring, populating accounts for our IdP service

FIXME: This is a section that I describe how to to setup up additional non-admin accounts in the htpasswd file. ...
